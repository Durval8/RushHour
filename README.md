# RushHour
Project done as apart of my studies at Universidade de Aveiro

The README contained inside the ia-tpg-rush-hour file explains the instructions to run the code, ALTHOUGH those instructions refer to the test of programs written by professors at UA, to correctly test my developed code the python3 client.py must be replaced by python3 student.py

I developed the following modules:
                    - student.py
                    - methods.py
                    - tree_search.py
